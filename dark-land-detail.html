                Dark Land is a 2D platformer game that I created as my first project for practice and a school assignment.
            Most of the assets in this game were taken from the Unity Asset Store and Pixabay.
        </p>
        <p>     The game tells the story of a miner working for a dark corporation.
            He is placed in an underground facility and is forced to work. He cannot escape
            because the entrance and exit are guarded by a butcher named Banken. One day, he decides
            to leave, and guided by an AI, he must defeat enemies and navigate a confusing maze.
