           Link Saver is an app I created to help me save links.  
           The idea came from my situation at home where I don't have Wi-Fi to download things.  
           So, when I'm at school, I take advantage of the school's Wi-Fi to download various files such as movies or games.  
           With this app, I can prepare the download links at home and download them later at school.
        </p>
        <p> 
           The way this app works is by saving links into a .txt file based on the selected category.  
           The .txt file will be saved in the folder we have previously set as the path.  
           Each category will generate its own file.
